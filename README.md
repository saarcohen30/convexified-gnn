# Convexified Graph Neural Networks for Distributed Control in Robotic Swarms
Code for implementation of convexified graph neural network (Cx-GNN), as well as its extensions, in the context of a swarm of flocking robots. Specifically, our methods are evaluated through the problem of collision-free flocking at the same velocity, a task in which robots aim to align their velocities and regulate their spacing.
